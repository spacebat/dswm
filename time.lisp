;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file contains code relating to the display of time.
;;
;; When setting `*time-format-string-default*' to look like you want, the
;; options are exactly the same as those in the output of date --help (with date
;; 6.12), with the exception of a few unimplemented functions (see the comments
;; in *time-format-string-alist*, below). `*time-modeline-string*' is also
;; customizable; it defaults to the same value as *time-format-string-default*.
;;

;; TODO:
;;
;; - Implement all options from date.
;; - Simplify code (fewer helper functions somehow?)

;; Code:
